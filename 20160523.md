sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt
s: stands for "substitution". it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.

The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.
A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.

A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project
git init creates a new Git repository
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log shows a list of all previous commits
